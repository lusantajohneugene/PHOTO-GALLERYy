  <h1>More Than Just a Code: <span class="accent">A Day in the Life of an IT Student</span></h1>
  <hr>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p class="highlight">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Honestly, if I had known earlier that IT would be this <span class="accent">intense</span>, I probably would
    have thought about it longer. Not saying I regret it, but it really hits different.
    Before, I thought IT was just about computers—typing code, staring at screens, and
    that’s it. But now, as an IT student, every day feels like a small battle with 
    <span class="accent">stress, sleepless nights, pressure, and endless deadlines</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    This blog is just me sharing what a <span class="accent">normal day in my IT life</span> really looks like.
    No sugarcoating—just a real story.
  </p>

  <h2>Morning: Wake Up, Check the Phone, Panic Mode</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Most of the time, my day starts with checking my phone. Messenger, group chats,
    Canvas, and even the time—just to see if I’m already late or if I still have a
    chance to make it. Most days, I already assume I’m late, and that’s when the
    <span class="accent">panic really kicks in</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Every morning, I use my father’s motorcycle to go to school. The ride usually
    takes around <span class="accent">30 to 60 minutes</span>. During the ride, my mind is already full of thoughts:
    unfinished tasks, upcoming deadlines, and whether I remembered to submit something
    or not.
  </p>

  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sometimes the road is calm, sometimes traffic is bad, but either way, that travel
    time gives me space to think. By the time I arrive at school, I’m already a bit
    exhausted, but I remind myself that this is just another day I need to get through
    and <span class="accent">learn from</span>.
  </p>

  <h2>Afternoon: Code, Errors, and a Bit of an Existential Crisis</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    When coding subjects start, this is the part where I sometimes stop and think,
    <span class="accent">“Is this really for me?”</span> There are days when I understand the lesson easily,
    and there are days when one small mistake in the code can keep me stuck for hours.
    It’s frustrating and draining.
  </p>

  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Sometimes I wonder if I’m just not good enough, but later on, I realized that
    this is actually <span class="accent">normal</span>. Everyone gets errors—even the good ones.
    The difference is they don’t quit right away.
  </p>

  <h2>Evening: Tired but Still Moving Forward</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    At night, the exhaustion really hits. Sometimes I review lessons, sometimes I
    just stare at the screen and think about how I survived the day. But despite
    everything, there’s still a small sense of <span class="accent">fulfillment</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Even if the path was full of errors, at least I <span class="accent">learned something</span>.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion / Reflection</h2>
  <p class="highlight">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    The truth is, IT is not for people who give up easily. It’s not enough to just
    be good with computers—you need <span class="accent">patience, resilience, and the courage to accept mistakes</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    If there’s one thing I’d tell myself and other IT students, it’s this: rest when
    you’re tired, complain if you need to, but <span class="accent">don’t quit</span>. One day, all these errors
    will be the reason you become <span class="accent">stronger</span>.
